# Game of Life

Inspired by recent events, I made my own implementation of Game of Life. Please attribute this to me when you copy it to use for your own personal enjoyment. Thanks.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, run `npm install`. You can then use Conway's Game of Life in your own project as you see fit using `require` stuff.

## Testing

To run the test suite, simply use `npm test`. You should not only see the tests pass, but your own version of the Game of Life running in your console!! Wonderful.

## Examples

I have kindly provided one example of the Game of Life implementation for you to distribute. Feel free to add more via pull request!!!
